# Tutorials
This repository contains almost all the tutorials I have written in all these years to date.

You'll find tutorials about reverse engineering, programming (C, ASM), exploit writing, software cracking, etc. All these tutorials were written specially for some web cracking groups such as Crackslatinos, ARTeam, SnD and more.
