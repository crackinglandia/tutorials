# Tutorials
This repository contains almost all the tutorials I have written in all these years to date.

You'll find tutorials about reverse engineering, programming (C, ASM), exploit writing, software cracking, etc. All these tutorials were written specially for some web cracking groups such as Crackslatinos, ARTeam, SnD and more.

Tutorials are not organized by categories but names are very descriptive. Most of the tutorials are written in Spanish but there are many written in English as well. Anyway, all the tutorials contain tons of images so being able to follow them will not be a problem.
